- 👋 Hi, I’m Paul Cairns (@paulcair)
- 👀 I’m interested in engineering, robotics, programming, and mechanical design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the MERN stack, python, 6DOF robot DH reference frames and forward and inverse kinematics. Hoping to create an OpenCV driven picknplace 6DOF robot.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my 6DOF robot. I could really use help. If you're any good at 6DOF robots please reach out.
- 📫 Check out my website: paul-cairns.com to see my portfolio.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play guitar
